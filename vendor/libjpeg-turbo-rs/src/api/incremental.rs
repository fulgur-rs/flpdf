//! Bounded-input-memory decode from a [`std::io::Read`] source
//! (P4-58, issue #357).
//!
//! Interleaved single-scan Huffman baseline streams — the overwhelming
//! majority of real-world JPEGs — decode from a **sliding window** of
//! compressed bytes: the window grows only while a single MCU row's
//! entropy data straddles its end, and consumed bytes are dropped as
//! rows commit, so peak input memory is a fixed window rather than the
//! whole stream. Progressive, non-interleaved multi-component,
//! arithmetic, lossless, and 12/16-bit streams require the full entropy
//! stream by construction, and single-component (grayscale) streams
//! decode through the one-block raster of P4-27, which the row loop
//! does not model; for all of those this entry point transparently
//! falls back to buffering, exactly like
//! [`decompress_from_reader`](crate::stream::decompress_from_reader).
//!
//! The marker-boundary scanner is shared with the C-ABI
//! `jpeg_consume_input` suspension core ([`crate::decode::boundary`]),
//! so this is not a third independent streaming mechanism (the P4-26
//! co-design constraint); the sliding window and the row checkpoints
//! are specific to this path.
