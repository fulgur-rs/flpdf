//! FFI B9-2: Pillow-against-libjpeg-turbo-rs-capi compatibility check.
//!
//! Shells out to `examples/pillow_smoke/run.sh`, which:
//!   1. builds `target/release/liblibjpeg_turbo_rs_capi.{so,dylib}`
//!   2. symlinks it as `libjpeg.so.62` / `libjpeg.62.dylib`
//!   3. spins up a Pillow venv and runs `test_pillow.py` against our shim
//!
//! Exit-code contract (see `test_pillow.py`):
//!   0 → PASS
//!   2 → SKIP (python/Pillow/fixture/network not available)
//!   3 → BLOCKER (symbol mismatch — Pillow cannot load our shim)
//!   1 → FAIL  (shim loaded but output was wrong)
//!
//! SKIP and BLOCKER are both reported via `eprintln!` + `return`, matching
//! the project's C-tool-missing pattern: the shim is a discovery target,
//! not a required feature, and a missing `jpeg_*` classic-API surface is
//! documented as the known blocker in `COORDINATOR_NOTES.md`.
