//! P2-11 regression: progressive encode with 4-pixel chroma sampling
//! factors (TJSAMP_411 / TJSAMP_441 / TJSAMP_410 / TJSAMP_24) must match
//! cjpeg byte-for-byte and self-roundtrip with low decode error.
//!
//! The bug was in `compress_progressive_with_scans` (and the arithmetic
//! progressive equivalent): the chroma block helper clamped `h_samp` and
//! `v_samp` to `{1, 2}`, so 4-pixel factors were silently downsampled to
//! 1/2 resolution while the SOF still advertised 1/4 resolution. Decoded
//! output diverged by max≈140 / mean≈9 per pixel.
//!
//! This test is C-tool-free (uses the Rust decoder) so it gates the fix
//! on every CI host. The byte-parity-against-cjpeg version lives in
//! `tests/c_tjcomptest.rs` (gated on `--features full-c-parity`).
//!
//! TDD-verified: re-introducing the original `if h_samp > 1 { 2 } else { 1 }`
//! clamp at all three sites in `src/encode/pipeline.rs` makes all four
//! `progressive_s*` tests below RED-fail with `max pixel diff 172-173`
//! (greater than the `≤ 50` ceiling). Removing the clamp restores GREEN.
//! That delta — not just the absolute pass — is what proves the test
//! gates the regression.
