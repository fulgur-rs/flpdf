//! Metamorphic option matrix: every encoder option must have an effect, and
//! that effect must not depend on which other options are set.
//!
//! Two properties are checked over the full cross-product of builder options
//! and pixel formats:
//!
//! - **effect** — `encode(base + O)` differs from `encode(base)`. An option
//!   that changes nothing is either being dropped or is a no-op nobody noticed.
//! - **independence** — `encode(base + O1 + O2)` differs from
//!   `encode(base + O2)`, for every ordered pair. If `O1` visibly works alone
//!   but stops working once `O2` is set, `O2` is masking it.
//!
//! Neither property needs an external oracle: they compare the implementation
//! against itself. That is the whole point — this is the cheapest class of bug
//! detection available, and it is what would have caught #313 and #322
//! automatically instead of by hand.
//!
//! # Known violations
//!
//! `KNOWN_VIOLATIONS` lists the pairs that fail today, each citing the issue
//! that tracks it. The list is enforced in **both directions**: an unlisted
//! violation fails the test, and a listed one that has started passing also
//! fails, with a message to delete the entry. An exemption list that silently
//! rots into a list of things that used to be broken is worse than no list.
